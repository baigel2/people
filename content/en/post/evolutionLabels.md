Exploring the power of labels and the effects of how they are used for better or for worse.

<!--more-->


# A thought experiment.

Imagine for a moment a villiage with a poulation of 100 families. Now imagine that in the culture of this villiage, special religious significance is given to people who are above 6ft tall and have green eyes.

If in the beginning we assume the villiga has a normal diversity of heights and eye colors but this new religion came in and swept the population by storm. For 10's of generations people were choosing partners based on their height and eye color.

This would mean that people above 6ft that have green eyes would be chosen before any others. Gradually over time, you would therefore see the avarage height of the population increase and a higher and higer percentage of the population with green eyes.

It might not ever reach 100% but it would eventually be the case that the overwhelming majority of the population would be over 6ft and have green eyes.

Follow me so far? Congratulations, you're now a kafir for believing in evolution. What? Don't worry, I'm joking. About the kafir part that is. But this explination is exactly what evolution or more specifically microevolution is.


# Micro vs Macro.

Microevolution is evolution within a single species. So changes in a population not a transformation of one species into another.

I don't understand why religous people reject this idea. I can understand why they might reject macroevolution:

* It proposes that one species can over vast, vast spans of time transform into a compeletly different species.
* It is often used by famous atheists to attach and attemt to debunk religions.

So naturally, anytime someone used an idea to attack your religion you would reflexivley want to or think about attacking them and their idea.

But here's the thing. According to the theory/* (and I'll get to the *theory* part injust a bit), of evolution, microevolution and macroevolution are essentialy the same thing over unimaginably different time scales. If you accept one, you are therefore accepting the other also.

I'm ok with making an exception for humans as Allah clearly states that He made Aadam Himself, not through a process of evolution.

However I don't know of anywhere in the Quran or hadith that says He didn't create other species by way of evolution. I mean on of His names is literally 'The Evolver' Al-Bari.

Peronally, I don't understand what it is about the theory of evolution itself (not how it is used) that people think disagrees with Islam.

It's something I'm going to dedicate some time to for sure to find out because I can't see anything un-Islamic about microevolution at the very least, and I can imagine it at least being possible that one species can, over eons and through the will of Allah, be transformed into another.

If we make an exception for humans then is there really anything wrong with it?

When people say that there is no evidence for evolution it becomes necassary to ask, what counts as evidence. Lets have a look, but first...

# It's "just" a theory.
