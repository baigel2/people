Born into a Sunni family, I've been learning about and internally exploring Shia Islam. Here are my thoughts so far.

<!--more-->

**Disclaimer:** I am not an expert in religion. I'm not even sure I count as a student of knowlege. I am however seeking knowlege. This is an opinion post not designed to prove one perspective true at the expence of the other.

If I had a choice I would just call myself Muslim. Not Shia, not Sunni, just Muslim. I don't really like the concept of vs in religion at all to be honest. It's like when you watch religious debates, one person on one side and another person opposite, both trying to win arguments and prove they are right and the other person is wrong, often resorting to insults and derogitory speech toward one another.

The objective of each side? To win.

I'm not here to win. I'm here to learn and I think if people had conversations instead of debates aiming to learn instead of win, we would make a lot more progress in much shorter spans of time.

# The religion of my forefathers.

One of the common themes we hear about in the Quran when Allah speaks about non believers is how they used to reject Islam not because they believed it to be false but because it was not the religion of their fathers and forefathers. Another example I find amusing is just before the time of the Prophet PBUH when the Jews and Chrisians used to boast to the pagan arabs that 'their' prophet would soon be coming to this area and then, led by him they would ruin the pagans, but then when they saw that Prophet rise from among the pagans themselves (though obviously not being pagan himself) they rejected him.

We Muslims like to think that we are beyond this sillyness. That we would not think about ourselves or others like this.

But let me ask you. Sunni, Shia or just Muslim. Did you choose to be who you are? Or did you simply accept what you were given without thought?

Unfortunate is not the word. I must find much more powerfull words to describe the utter tragadies that have occurred throught the history of Islam. Family members of the Prophet himself, killed by people who professed to being Muslim!

Until this day Sunnis and Shias kill each other in some parts of the world and live together harmoneously in others.

Raised as a Sunni (though I have ventured outside of Islam as well in the past) when I had the opportunity to experience worshiping in a Shia mosque for the first time earlier this year (2025) something incredible happened that I had never experienced before. A spiritual experience that has kept me going to the same mosue ever since.

# Praying behind the Prophet.

Earlier in the year I, along with most of the other people at work were invited to go to a - khatam? see booklet draft in google docs.
